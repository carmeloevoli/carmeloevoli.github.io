### Welcome to the High-energy AstroParticle Physics Journal Club (**HAPPJ**)!

+ Our *weekly* meetings serve as a platform for discussing the latest papers and findings in High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Gamma and Neutrino Astrophysics, but also to share exciting new results, puzzles about some difficulties you can't overcome, or simply your enthusiasm for a new field you found about.

+ *Time:* Every Thursday at 2:15 PM, Fontana Luminosa Local Time.

+ *Location:* [GSSI Red Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4EbHgcBQQ88w7nx6) (the building formerly known as Ex-INPS), Floor -1. 

+ We keep track of papers to discuss on the HAPPJ [ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/_UjJX4qdQaupa0qbeq2SOg).

+ We are committed to keep our meetings lasting no more than *one hour*.

+ To participate and receive regular updates on dates and topics, please consider joining our [ML](https://lists.infn.it/sympa/subscribe/happj).
