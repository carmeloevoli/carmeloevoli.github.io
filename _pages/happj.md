+ Welcome to the High-energy AstroParticle Physics Journal Club (**HAPPJ**)!

+ Our *weekly* meetings serve as a platform for discussing the latest papers and findings in High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Gamma and Neutrino Astrophysics, but also to share exciting new results, puzzles about some difficulties you can't overcome, or simply your enthusiasm for a new field you found about.

+ *Time:* Every Friday at 9:30 AM, Fontana Luminosa local time.

+ *Location:* GSSI Red Building (the building formerly known as Ex-INPS), Floor -1. 

+ We keep track of papers to discuss on the HAPPJ journal club benty-fields.

+ We are committed to keep our meetings lasting no more than *one hour*.

+ To participate and receive regular updates on dates and topics, please contact [me](mailto:carmelo.evoli@gssi.it).
