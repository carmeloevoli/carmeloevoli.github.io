### **1. Photon energies and wavelengths**

  - Determine the typical energies in electron volts (eV) for the following types of photons: microwave, far-infrared, near-infrated, optical, and UV.
  - Conversevely, given photons with energies of 1 keV, 100 keV, and 1 TeV, determine their frequencies and wavelengths.
  
### **2. Galactic Synchrotron Emission**

  The brightness temperature $T_b$ of synchrotron emission from the Galactic plane is observed within the frequency range of 8 GHz to 480 MHz, and is approximately given by:
$$T_b \approx 250 \left( \frac{\nu}{480~\text{MHz}} \right)^{-2.8}~\text{K}$$

  This emission is attributed to cosmic ray electrons gyrating around the Galactic magnetic field, which has an average strength of approximately 3 Î¼G. 

   - Derive an approximate formula for the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons. Clearly specify the range of energies for which your derived expression is applicable. Consider here that the emitting region spans about 10 kpc and is optically thin.
   - Compare the derived differential energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons to that of cosmic ray protons [[PDG]](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/reviews/rpp2023-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf).
   - Quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of cosmic ray protons to the overall Galactic synchrotron emission. 
   - Estimate the gyro-radii of cosmic ray electrons and protons at the minimum $E_{\rm min}$ and maximum $E_{\rm max}$ energy values. Compare these estimates to the overall size of the Galaxy.
 
### **3. Synchrotron energetics and Electron Cooling**

  Consider a population of electrons described by a power-law distribution in terms of their Lorentz factor $\gamma$, given as $N(\gamma)d\gamma = \gamma^{-p}d\gamma$, where $p$ is the power-law index and the distribution extends from $\gamma_{\text{min}}$ to $\gamma_{\text{max}}$.

  - Derive the expression for the total energy density $U_e$ of electrons within the specified $\gamma$ range. Show that it can be approximated by $$U_e = \left(\frac{p-1}{p-2}\right) \gamma_{\text{min}} n_e m_e c^2$$
  - With $p = 2.5$, calculate the cooling time for electrons due to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Express your answer in terms of $\gamma_{\text{min}}$ and $\gamma_{\text{max}}$, presenting the timescale in Myr and the energy density in erg/cm $^3$.
  - Calculate the cooling time for electrons via inverse Compton scattering off of CMB photons. Estimate at what redshift this cooling time becomes shorter than the age of the Universe.
   - For the radio lobes of Cygnus A, which span approximately 50 kpc and emit a total luminosity of $\sim 10^{45}$ erg/s at radio frequencies around several GHz, assume a magnetic field strength of $\sim 10^{-4}$ G. Determine the power radiated per electron. Using your result, calculate the electron energy density. Compare this with the magnetic energy density to discuss the energetics of the radio lobes.
