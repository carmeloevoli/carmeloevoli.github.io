### **1. Photon energies and wavelengths**<a name="ex1"></a>

  A warm-up exercise here:
  
  - Determine the typical energies in electron volts (eV) for the following types of photons: microwave, far-infrared, near-infrated, optical, and UV.
  - Conversevely, given photons with energies of 1 keV, 100 keV, and 1 TeV, determine their frequencies and wavelengths.

### **2. Diffuse Synchrotron Emission from Galactic Cosmic Ray Electrons**

  The brightness temperature $T_b$ of synchrotron emission from the Galactic plane is observed within the frequency range of 8 GHz to 480 MHz, and is approximately given by:
$$T_b \approx 250 \left( \frac{\nu}{480~\text{MHz}} \right)^{-2.8}~\text{K}$$

  This emission is attributed to cosmic ray electrons gyrating around the Galactic magnetic field, which has an average strength of approximately 3 Î¼G. 

   - Derive an approximate formula for the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons. Clearly specify the range of energies for which your derived expression is applicable. Consider here that the emitting region spans about 10 kpc and is optically thin.
   - Compare the derived differential energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons to that of cosmic ray protons [[PDG]](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/reviews/rpp2023-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf).
   - Quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of cosmic ray protons to the overall Galactic synchrotron emission. 
   - Estimate the gyro-radii of cosmic ray electrons and protons at the minimum $E_{\rm min}$ and maximum $E_{\rm max}$ energy values. Compare these estimates to the overall size of the Galaxy.

### **3. Synchrotron energetics and Electron Cooling**

  Consider a population of electrons described by a power-law distribution in terms of their Lorentz factor $\gamma$, given as $N(\gamma)d\gamma = \gamma^{-p}d\gamma$, where $p$ is the power-law index and the distribution extends from $\gamma_{\text{min}}$ to $\gamma_{\text{max}}$.

  - Derive the expression for the total energy density $U_e$ of electrons within the specified $\gamma$ range. Show that it can be approximated by $$U_e = \left(\frac{p-1}{p-2}\right) \gamma_{\text{min}} n_e m_e c^2$$
  - With $p = 2.5$, calculate the cooling time for electrons due to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Express your answer in terms of $\gamma_{\text{min}}$ and $\gamma_{\text{max}}$, presenting the timescale in Myr and the energy density in erg/cm $^3$.
  - Calculate the cooling time for electrons via inverse Compton scattering off of CMB photons. Estimate at what redshift this cooling time becomes shorter than the age of the Universe.
   - For the radio lobes of Cygnus A, which span approximately 50 kpc and emit a total luminosity of $\sim 10^{45}$ erg/s at radio frequencies around several GHz, assume a magnetic field strength of $\sim 10^{-4}$ G. Determine the power radiated per electron. Using your result, calculate the electron energy density. Compare this with the magnetic energy density to discuss the energetics of the radio lobes.

### **4. Universe reionization**

  The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) at redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ is observed to be highly ionized, likely due to radiation from galaxies and quasars. Post-recombination at $z \sim 10^3$, the IGM was almost completely neutral. This observation indicates that reionization of the IGM occurred somewhere $z_r \gtrsim 10$, although the exact timing of this crucial transition remains unknown. 

  An ionized IGM scatters CMB photons by Thomson scattering. Under the assumption of a uniform Universe with a specified baryon fraction $\Omega_b$ in units of the critical density $\Omega_c$, derive the relation between $\tau_r$ and $z_r$ and calculate $\tau_r$ assuming a reionization redshift $z_r = 10$ for an Einstein-de Sitter Universe.

### **5. Low diffusivity around TeV halos**

  TeV halos, extended regions of very high-energy (~TeV) gamma-ray emission, have been observed surrounding several middle-aged pulsars, such as Geminga

   - Utilizing the known distance to [Geminga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminga) and given that the angular extension of its TeV halo is approximately \(\theta \sim 4.5^\circ\), calculate the halo's physical size.
   - Assuming electrons are initially emitted from the center of the halo, estimate the local diffusion coefficient, $D$, using the formula $D \sim H^2/\tau$, where $H$ represents the halo size, and $\tau$ is the energy loss timescale. Consider energy losses primarily due to IC scattering on CMB.
   - Compare the result with the Bohm diffusion coefficient, which is the smaller possible diffusion coefficient.
   - Discuss the scenario in which the gamma-ray emission occurs in the Klein-Nishina regime. Explain the conditions under which the photon field would result in this regime being applicable.

### **6. Constraints on the ExtraGalactic Background Light from very-high-energy observations of blazars**

  The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is a significant factor in the absorption of gamma rays from distant astronomical objects, such as blazars, through the mechanism of pair production. This exercise explores how to estimate an upper limit for the average EBL intensity as a function of the redshift (\(z\)), using observations of gamma rays at TeV energies.

   - Utilize observations of gamma rays with energies $E_\gamma \sim 1$ TeV from a blazar at a given redshift $z$ to outline a method to determine a conservative upper limit for the average EBL intensity as a function of $z$. Assume that $dt/dz$ can be approximated by $H^{-1}$, and that all EBL photons have the energy where the pair-production cross section is maximized (*monochromatic approximation*).
