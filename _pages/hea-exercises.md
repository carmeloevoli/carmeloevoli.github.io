#### **1. Photon energies and wavelengths**

  - Determine the typical energies in electron volts (eV) for the following types of photons: microwave, far-infrared, near-infrated, optical, and UV.
  - Conversevely, given photons with energies of 1 keV, 100 keV, and 1 TeV, determine their frequencies and wavelengths.
  
#### **2. Galactic Synchrotron Emission**

  The brightness temperature $T_b$ of synchrotron emission from the Galactic plane is observed within the frequency range of 8 GHz to 480 MHz, and is approximately given by:
$$T_b \approx 250 \left( \frac{\nu}{480~\text{MHz}} \right)^{-2.8}~\text{K}$$

  This emission is attributed to cosmic ray electrons gyrating around the Galactic magnetic field, which has an average strength of approximately 3 Î¼G. 

   - Derive an approximate formula for the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons. Clearly specify the range of energies for which your derived expression is applicable. Consider here that the emitting region spans about 10 kpc and is optically thin.
   - Compare the derived differential energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons to that of cosmic ray protons [[PDG]](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/reviews/rpp2023-rev-cosmic-rays.pdf).
   - Quantitatively estimate the relative contribution of cosmic ray protons to the overall Galactic synchrotron emission. 
   - Estimate the gyro-radii of cosmic ray electrons and protons at the minimum $E_{\rm min}$ and maximum $E_{\rm max}$ energy values. Compare these estimates to the overall size of the Galaxy.
