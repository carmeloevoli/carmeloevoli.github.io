### Short bio ###

I began my academic journey at the University of Pisa, where I earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics, before moving to Trieste to pursue a PhD in Astrophysics at the International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA). After completing my doctorate, I held postdoctoral positions at the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC) in Beijing and at Hamburg University in Germany. In 2018, I was awarded a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship to continue my research on Galactic Cosmic Rays. Since 2019, I have been a member of the faculty at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, where I currently serve as associate professor. 

In 2022, I joined the [Pierre Auger Observatory](www.auger.org) Collaboration.
